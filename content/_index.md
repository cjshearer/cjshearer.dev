Hi I'm Cody, a software engineer at BlueCross BlueShield of SC.

As a productivity and workflow enthusiast, I enjoy building tools and processes that encourage reproducibility, maintainability, and [simplicity](https://grugbrain.dev/) in my work.

Outside of work, you can find me bouldering, hacking on [my NixOS configuration](https://github.com/cjshearer/nixos-config), or building [my custom mechanical keyboard](https://github.com/cjshearer/cweep).

My plan for this site is to share my projects, write about what I'm learning, and document my journey as a software engineer.
